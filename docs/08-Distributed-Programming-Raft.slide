* About this Lecture: Some Thoughts
- Goal of this lecture is to look at a non trivial example in Go.
- The problem we look at, is language agnostic.
- It can be implemented in almost every language.
- It combines concurrent programming and network programming.
- It contains non trivial logic.
- It is a real world example with high relevance.

* Distributed Programming
- Concurrent System - multiple execution points (threads, processes or via network)
- Distributed System - processes are running on different networked processors
- Parallel System - like a distributed system, but more closely coupled (shared memory or fast bus)

Terms are not always used consistently.

: Nebenläufiges System: es gibt mehrere separate Ausführungspunkte (egal ob Threads/Prozess oder über Netzwerk)
: Verteiltes System: Prozesse laufen auf unterschiedlichen Prozessoren, die oft weit auseinderliegen, aber verbunden sind
: Paralleles System: wie verteiltes System, aber enger gekoppelt (gemeinsamer Speicher, schneller Bus)

: * Message Passing
: Message Passing is invoking behavior on a separate process (not necessarily on the same computer) by sending messages.

: Models for exchanging messages:

: - point to point (symmetric/asymmetric, synchronous/asynchronous)
: - remote procedure calls (RPC, RMI)
: - broadcasting and multicasting

: Sender schickt Nachricht an Empfänger
: symmetrisch: beide kennen sich / asymmetrisch: nur ein eine Richtung
: synchron: blockiert bis Nachricht gelesen
: RPI: wie lokaler Prozeduraufruf

* The two general problem

.image ./img/08-two-generals-problem.png 400 _

- The two generals problem is a thought experiment in distributed computing and unsolvable when the communication might fail.
- We need a pragmatic solution.

* Discussion: How would you solve the problem?

Three armies, each led by a general, plan to attack a fortified city. The armies may arrive at different times to surround the city, and none of the generals can be certain whether all the armies will arrive at all. Consequently, they have not appointed a single leader.
For the attack to succeed, at least two armies must strike simultaneously. Therefore, the generals need to coordinate and agree on a precise time to launch the attack. They can only communicate by sending messengers.

- Under the assumption of an already selected leader and reliable communication.
- Under the assumption of an already selected leader and unreliable communication.
- Under the assumption of an unselected leader and an unreliable communication.

: Reliable communication and all leaders are present: Just number the armies 0,1,2 and 0 is the leader. It sends the time to attack to 1 and 2.
: They confirm back. After receiving both confirmations, 0 sends a final go message.

* Algorithms under ideal conditions

*Reliable* *communication* *and* *all* *leaders* *are* *present*
- Just number the armies 0, 1, 2. Army 0 is the leader per definition.
- It sends the time to attack to 1 and 2.

*Unreliable* *communication* *and* *all* *leaders* *are* *present*
Not solvable, but can be approximated by a two phase commit
- Just number the armies 0, 1, 2. Army 0 is the leader per definition.
- Leader 0 sends the time to attack to 1 and 2.
- They confirm back.
- After receiving both confirmations, army 0 sends a final go message.




* What is Distributed Consensus?

The consensus problem requires agreement among a number of processes on a single data value.
Distributed consensus protocols can be used for distributed databases which should stay consistent:

- The system stays consistent even if some nodes goes down
- The system stays consistent if a network partition occurs (but could get unavailable)
- The system never responds with wrong or inconsistent data (different responses from nodes)

* The CAP Theorem
In a distributed system the following requirements can be met:

- *Consistency*  - Data is the same across the cluster, so you can read or write from/to any node and get the same data.
- *Availability* - The system stays available even if one or more member goes down
- *Partition* *Tolerance* - If parts of the system loose connection to other parts, the system stays alive

Pick Two: Only two requirements can be met -> CP, AP are typical (CA does not exists)
.link https://codahale.com/you-cant-sacrifice-partition-tolerance/

Availability,Partition Tolerance = DNS (Domain Name System)
Consistency,Partition Tolerance = Cash Machine

* Securing C and P
- All known algorithms use the concept of a quorum to detect network partition problems
- Only the partition with the majority of nodes stay alive to ensure consistency
- All known algorithms use the concept of a Master or Leader node to control replication
- All known algorithms use a replicated log and implement a two phase commit.
- A replicated log is a list of all changes which are applied to the system

: Consistency & Partition Tolerance

* Two Phase Commit
Phases:

- Prepare Phase - Data is persisted on all members. Data is not visible but stored.
- Commit Phase - Persisted data will be executed. Data gets visible.
- This is typically implemented with an append only log (transaction log) and a state machine which reads the log entries and loads them into memory.

This is equivalent with two round trips in the two general problem.

* What is Raft?
- Raft is a protocol for distributed consensus
- Raft is designed to be easy understandable
- Raft predecessor Paxos was highly complex
- Most Paxos implementations are buggy or academic 
- Raft was developed 2014 in a PhD thesis at Stanford University
- Zookeeper ZAB is an alternative but more complex solution

* Who uses Raft?
- ectd - The Cloud Native key value store -> Part of Kubernetes!
- Docker Swarm - Docker in cluster mode
- dgraph - A Scalable, Distributed, Low Latency, High Throughput Graph Database
- tikv - A Distributed transactional key value database powered by Rust and Raft
- swarmkit - A toolkit for orchestrating distributed systems at any scale.
- chain core - Software for operating permissioned, multi-asset blockchain networks
- Elastic Search - Distributed Search engine (=document oriented database)
- ...

* The Raft Algorithm
- Raft is based on a replicated state machine with the states: *FOLLOWER*, *CANDIDATE* and *LEADER*
- All nodes start in the FOLLOWER state
- The leader is responsible for sending heartbeat message to all members
- The leader is responsible to replicate data to all other nodes (2 phase commit)
- If a member does not receive a leader message in a random timeout interval, an election starts
- During an election a candidate sends vote messages to all cluster members
- The election is won, if a quorum (>50% = n/2 + 1) of members respond with OK

* The Raft State Model
- There is only one Leader which is responsible for consistency and replication

* Implementing Raft with Go
The most prominent implementation is the Raft implementation of Etcd (Part of Kubernetes)
.link https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/tree/master/raft
This implementation is highly optimized and abstracts from the Raft paper

Other implementations

.link https://github.com/hashicorp/raft
.link https://github.com/search?q=go-raft
.link https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf Read the Raft paper for specification

* Is it possible to build your own Raft implementation?
Requirements and Decisions

- We want to stay close on the original specification, but focus especially on the leader election.
- We limit our use case to only 3 nodes.
- We want to use easy built-in network mechanisms in Go such as HTTP. JSON not strictly necessary

* Interesting Parts
- State Machine
- Concurrency: Behavior of remote calls, election and heartbeat timers
- Design: Timer implementation

* Exercise 8.2: Be Creative!

Three armies, each led by a general, plan to attack a fortified city. The armies may arrive at different times to surround the city, and none of the generals can be certain whether all the armies will arrive at all. Consequently, they have not appointed a single leader.
For the attack to succeed, at least two armies must strike simultaneously. Therefore, the generals need to coordinate and agree on a precise time to launch the attack.
To achieve this, they decide to use a simplified version of the Raft algorithm.

- Write your own Raft Implementation!

* Summary
- Go is an excellent choice to implement an distributed protocol like Raft
- You can implement the Raft specification with ca 1000-2000 Loc 
- You can learn from the Etcd implementation, which is on Github
- Building a production safe implementation is hard in any language anyway!

: TODO: Exersice: Distributed calculation of the Collatz Conjecture
: TODO Use TCP Stream, HTTP with JSON, HTTP with XML, GRPC
: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=094y1Z2wpJg
: Extends to blocks to optimize


: Organize a coordinated attack of multiple separate armies by reaching consensus on when to attack.

: Follow these assumptions
: 1. The generals never lie. You trust them.
: 2. The leader has the id 0. All generals connect to them via RPC.
: 3. Focus only on one possible failure. Either the generals answer timeouts or disconnects.
