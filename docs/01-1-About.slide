* What are concepts of programming languages?

- Syntax (Basic vocabulary, grammar)
- Semantics (The meaning of the program)
- Names (variabes, types, functions, classes, objects, but also scope, visibility, lifetime)
- Data Types (simple, structured)
- Flow control (for, if, ....)
- Functional programming (function as first class citizen)
- Object Oriented Programming
- Debugging
- Exception handling
- Concurrency handling
- Memory management

* Goal of the Course

.image img/go.png 200 _
- Gain knowledge about the concepts of existing programming languages
- Looking beyond the horizon
- Increased ability to learn new languages
- Learn how Go differs from other languages conceptually
- Learn how to write professional code with Golang
- Gain skills to pick the right language for a given problem

* Course Requirements
- The course is designed as a master course.
- Solid programming skills in at least one language are required.
- It is assumed that students have some skills in other programming languages.
- For most of the code examples, we will use Go (Golang) as language.

* This lecture is not yet AI ready

- Companies will demand to use AI tools such as SWE-Agents in the future
- This lecture (as any other lecture) it not yet designed for this future
- This semester work at home might become too easy with AI tools
- â®• More weight on the presentation


: * Administration
: - COVID-19 rules apply. See https://www.th-rosenheim.de/index.php?id=16926
: - All participants *must* be signed up to the lecture on the Learning Campus platform
