# Exercise 5 - Functional Programming in Go

If you do not finish during the lecture period, please finish it as homework.

## Exercise 5.1 - Warm Up

Write a Go program which shows the following concepts:

- Functions as Variables
- Anonymous Functions
- High Order Functions (functions as parameters or return values)
- Closures (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming))

## Exercise 5.2 - Filter

Given a list of strings, write a function `Filter` which takes a 
filter function as argument and filters all elements of the array, which do 
not match the filter function.

What type must the filter function have?
Filter out all strings which do not contain digits.

E.g.

```go
    doesNotContainDigits := func .....
    array := []strings{"a", "b3b", "c", "12", "D"}
    result := Filter(strings, doesNotContainDigits)
	fmt.Println(result) // "a", "bb", "c", "D" 
```
 
## Exercise 5.3 - Map / Filter / Reduce

Expand the Exercice 5.2 to a Map / Filter / Reduce streaming solution.

Map/Reduce is a famous functional construct implemented in many parallel and distributed collection frameworks like
Hadoop, Apache Spark, Java Streams (not distributed but parallel), C# Linq

- Implement a custom M/R API with the following interface:

 ```go
    type Stream interface {
    	Map(m Mapper) Stream
    	Filter(p Predicate) Stream
    	Reduce(a Accumulator) any
    }
```
First Limit the Stream to a single type, e.g. a stream of strings.

The usage of the interface should be like this:
```go
    stringSlice := []any{"a", "b", "c", "1", "D"}

	// Map/Reduce
	result := ToStream(stringSlice).
		Map(toUpperCase).
		Filter(notDigit).
		Reduce(concat)

	if result != "A,B,C,D" {
		t.Error(fmt.Sprintf("Result should be 'A,B,C,D' but is: %v", result))
    }
```

*Question*
- What is the type of Mapper, Predicate and Accumulator?
- How can you make the types generic, so they work for any type, not only for string?

TODO: trennung zwischen impl und beispiel
TODO: evtl. kein Reduce. Zu komplex. Vorher gut erkl√§ren. Studenten kennen evtl. keine Streams.

## Exercise 5.4 - Word Count (WC)

Word Count is a famous algorithm for demonstrating the power of distributed collections and functional programming. 
Word Count counts how often a word (string) occurs in a collection. It is easy to address that problem with shared state (a map), but
this solution does not scale well.
The question here is how to use a pure functional algorithm to enable parallel and distributed execution.

After running Word Count, you should get the following result:

INPUT:  "A" "B" "C" "A" "B" "A"

OUTPUT: ("A":3) ("B":2) ("C":1) 

*Questions*
- How can you implement the problem with the already built Map()/Filter()/Reduce() functions?
- Write an Unit Test to prove that your solution works as expected!
