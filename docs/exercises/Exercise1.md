# Exercise 1 - Getting Started with Go

If you do not finish during the lecture period, please finish it as homework.

## Setup

- Install Go from <https://golang.org> or install via a repository manager 
- Test if `go` can be executed from the command line.
- Check the Go environment via `go env`, especially the variable GOPATH. There the external dependencies are installed.
- Create your Go workspace directory
- Create a `HelloWorld.go`
- Test the `HelloWorld` program with "go run HelloWorld.go"
- Compile the `HelloWorld` program with "go build". You need to init the module first via `go mod init HelloWorld`. Check the content of the created file go.mod.
- Optional, but desirable: Install Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ, GoLand or any other Editor with Go support and get familiar with it.
- Try to run the hello world example code inside <https://goplay.tools/>
  Alternative: <https://play.golang.org/>
  Alternative: <https://go-playground-wasm.vercel.app/>
- Learn the basics by understanding the first seven examples at <https://gobyexample.com/>
