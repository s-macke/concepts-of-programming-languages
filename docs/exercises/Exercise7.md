# Exercise 7 - Distributed Consensus and the Raft Algorithm

If you do not finish during the lecture period, please finish it as homework.

## Exercise 7.1 - Read the Raft Paper

Read the [Raft Paper](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf):

* Section 1
* Section 2
* Section 4
* Section 5 (until including 5.3)

## Exercise 7.2 - Coding

Be creative and write your own Raft Implementation!

**Examples:**

* Testable key value store using interfaces and goroutines:

* Networkable implementation using gRPC (voting only):  
  https://github.com/s-macke/concepts-of-programming-languages/tree/master/src/distributed/raft
* Highly abstracted from the paper:
  https://github.com/hashicorp/src/raft
* More implementations:
